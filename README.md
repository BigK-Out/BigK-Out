# Hi there! I'm MÃ¼rsel Alpakin OLGUN ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18-year-old web developer and student at Politecnico di Torino. I enjoy working at the intersection of technology and creativity, pushing the boundaries of web development with tools like **React**, **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **GSAP**, **Framer Motion**, and **Three.js**.

### ðŸ’» What I'm Working On
- Crafting dynamic web experiences with **React** and **Three.js**.
- Developing interactive portfolios and personal projects, combining cutting-edge frontend technologies.
- Merging various design techniques with **Anime.js** and **React Three Fiber** to bring ideas to life.
- Building AI systems, where I explore and implement the next generation of intelligent digital assistants.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm Learning
I'm constantly expanding my knowledge, particularly in:
- **3D web development**: Creating immersive experiences with **Three.js**.
- **AI Development**: I'm designing my own intelligent systems inspired by the interaction with AI models like this one.

### ðŸ“š Current Projects
- **Portfolio for a Swiss artist**: A creative imaginary portfolio showcasing artistic works using modern web technologies.
- **Three.js Experiments**: Randomly generated dog models in a 3D scene with ripple effectsâ€”merging perspective and orthographic cameras.

### ðŸ›  Technologies & Skills
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, GSAP, Anime.js, Framer Motion, Webflow, WordPress
- **3D Development**: Three.js, React Three Fiber
- **Tools**: Postman, MongoDB, Vite, Visual Studio Code, Git

### ðŸ“ˆ My Approach
I'm a developer who values discipline, whether itâ€™s in coding or personal growth. I believe in honing my craft through consistent practice, research, and self-reflection. My projects are driven by a passion for innovation and a commitment to quality, always striving to bridge the gap between creativity and technology.

### ðŸŽ¯ Fun Facts About Me
- I'm a big fan of **Dead Cells**, a fast-paced roguelike game that keeps me sharp.
- I enjoy experimenting with new frameworks and design patterns, always looking for ways to optimize and enhance my work.
- I have a knack for refining small detailsâ€”like ensuring animations don't reset after they end (thanks to **animation-fill-mode: forwards**)!
